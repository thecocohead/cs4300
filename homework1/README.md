## Running Instructions
First, create a virtual environment into `/.venv`. One is provided on the turn-in for convenience, but is removed from the git directories via gitignore. Second, install the packages found in `/requirements.txt`. 

If you're using Visual Studio Code, configure your pytest directory as `/homework1/tests`.
